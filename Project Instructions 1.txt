Title:

Url Converter

Goal: Please go to the URL provided here: https://old.domain.com. No wait... that was supposed to be https://new.domain.com. If only there was a way to easily change links to the new domain instead of manually modifying them every time.

Create a script that takes a URL for the old domain as an input and returns a URL using the new domain. This script should include input validation ensuring that the input is actually a URL and the URL is for the old domain.

Bonus:

Instead of returning the new URL, the script should open up my browser and navigate to the new URL.
