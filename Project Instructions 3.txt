Python Beginner Project #3 

 

Title:  

URL Defang Script/Tool 

Goal:  

Create a script that prompts the user to enter a potentially malicious URL, where in the script will remove & replace elements that would allow itâ€™s use if clicked. This replacement should allow the URL to be easily readable. This script should then rest and await an additional URL entry. 

Enhancements:  

Using Pyperclip to send elements to users' clipboard. 

Example: 

Before: https://example.com/malicious/link 

After: hxxps[://]example[.]com/malicious/link
